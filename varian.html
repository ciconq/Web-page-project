    <p>
      The gladiator king of Stormwind City,<br>
      Varian Wrynn, has lived many lives.<br>
      His anger shook the orcish hordes,<br>
      his devotion preserved a nation.<br>
      By wielding the sword Shalamayne<br>
      two-handed, split into twin blades,<br>
      or with a shield, Varian shifts his combat tactics:<br>
      charging into melee with multiple opponents,<br>
      enduring punishment or dueling one-on-one.<br>
      Whether King Wrynn or Lo'Gosh the Ghost Wolf stands<br>
      on the battlefield, the prowess of the man remains the same.<br>
