      On Zerus, the zerg pack leader Dehaka was<br>
      a constantly evolving apex predator.<br>
      His drive to slay the strongest prey and consume their<br>
      Essence has now led him to the Nexus, where Dehaka<br>
      stalks his opponents across the battlefield.<br>
      Able to regenerate through massive damage<br>
      and swiftly move into and out of combat,<br>
      Dehaka uses the primal zerg's mutability<br>
      to deadly effect.<br>
