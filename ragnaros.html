    <p>
      Ragnaros, an elemental as old as the world of Azeroth,<br>
      has been called to many realmsâ€¦ but rarely one so suited<br>
      to his destructive nature as the Nexus.<br>
      As he strives to reduce this new land to ash,<br>
      Ragnaros hews about with the fiery hammer Sulfuras<br>
      and takes command of allied<br>
      and destroyed forts,<br>
      scourging all who approach him<br>
      with falling rocks and waves of magma.<br>
      Though his power is vast,<br>
      those who summon the Firelord<br>
      must be prepared<br>
      to watch the world burn.<br>
